## Installation

Eleventy is a static site generator based on Javascript, so you will need node and npm/yarn to run it.
Inside the project root, run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies.

## Getting Started

The local development environment uses gulp to process various stuff for the site. 
The most important commands can be run as npm scripts:

`npm start`: make a development build and serve the site through browsersync  
`npm run build`: make a production build  
`npm run serve`: serve the current build `dist` directory  
`npm run debug`: start Eleventy in debug mode and serve the site  
`npm run serve:lambda`: serve lambda functions with netlify-lambda  
`npm run build:lambda`: compile lambda functions for production
