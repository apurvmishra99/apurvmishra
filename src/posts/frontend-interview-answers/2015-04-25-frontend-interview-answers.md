I recently came across the H5BPâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions">Frontend Developer Interview Questions</a>. Itâ€™s a collection of questions related to building websites, meant for employers to vet potential candidates for a job.

Although Iâ€™m currently not looking for a (regular) job, I thought it would be interesting to try and answer as many as possible and see where I stand. 

I think when you first start learning about web development, you cover all these basic principles, but once you get better and move on to more advanced problems, you donâ€™t really think about them anymore. So it canâ€™t hurt to revise that stuff every once in a while, right?

Thereâ€™s questions on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and general programming knowledge.
It was an interesting exercise because it got me thinking a lot about these fundamentals. If you're interested, I published [my answers on github](https://github.com/maxboeck/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions).

Of course, some of these questions depend strongly on the context, and some are deliberately phrased to provoke a discussion. Itâ€™s a lot of questions, and I didnâ€™t want to write a novel there (since, again, this was just for my own curiosity).

So my answers are far from perfect and in some cases barely scratch the surface of a topic. But hey, Iâ€™m not on trial here, so calm down ðŸ˜‰
