I did some housekeeping over the holidays and ported my website to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io)! The previous version was based on Jekyll - which is fine but got a bit slow, and since I don't know Ruby, the generator was always a bit of a mystery to me. Eleventy runs on node / Javascript, so I have more control over whats going on.

I have also switched to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting - it's super developer friendly and makes a lot of difficult tasks just work out of the box. Loving it so far!

I have some ideas for the `notes` section, the webmentions and a few other *#indieweb* features I'd like to explore, but for now I'm pretty happy with how the site turned out.

As always, the [source code]({{ site.repo }}) is public on Github, if anyone is interested in the specifics. ðŸ˜‰
